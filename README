The task is to connect N computers with cables that can communicate in both directions and to check if those computers can actually interact with each other. Solution will follow the two instructions shown below:



1. make A B time

Connect Computer A and Computer B with a cable.

This cable will become unavailable when the value is bigger than time seconds. If the

value equals to time seconds, the cable is still available.

Multiple cables may be connected between aforementioned Computer A and B.



2. check A B time

Predict if computer A and B can communicate within time seconds with the connected

cable(s). Computer A and B may be connected through other computers. If Computer A and B can communicate, output 'YES'in one string. If they can’t, output 'NO'in one string. The cables that are connected by all the make instructions existing after particular check instruction are not available in time series.

The instructions will be processed in the descending order of input.

Determine if Computer A and B are able to communicate every time there is check

instruction. If they can communicate, please output 'YES'in one string. If not, output 'NO'in

one string.


Input


Input will be given in the following format from Standard Input:

N Q

S A B time

1 1 1 1

:

S A B time

Q Q Q Q



1. On the first string, N(2≦N≦20), an integer which shows the number of computers, and

Q(1≦Q≦500), another integer which shows the number of the instructions, will be given

with a half­width break.


2. From the second string to the N − th string, you will be given instructions.

1≦A , B ≦N and 1≦time ≦10 are guaranteed.

There are only two kinds of S : make or check.


Output

Determine if Computer A and B are able to communicate every time there is check instruction.

If they can communicate, please output 'YES'in one string. If not, output 'NO'in one string.

Also, make sure to insert a line break at the end of the output.
